# TravelTimeVisualisation

My goal was to know at wich time i can go to work and back home, without getting in too much traffic. 
I accomblished that by collecting Data from the Google Maps API to a Server. This Project exists to read this collected Data 
and make it easily readable by using a Graph.

## Used Frameworks

I used Gson ( https://github.com/google/gson ) for parsing JSON-Code that i use in my PHP Scripts
and for the Graphs i used MPAndroidChart ( https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart )
